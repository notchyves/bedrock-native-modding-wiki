# Your First Hook

::: info
You can find the reference code for this section [here](https://github.com/bedrock-native-modding/beginners-guide-example/tree/sections/your-first-hook).

Now that you have your mod working, you probably want it to do something instead of crashing the game.

In this section, we will hook `Dimension::getTimeOfDay` to make time appear to pass faster. 
We'll need to scan a signature to find this function, and then hook the function.
To do this, we'll need to add some dependency libraries.

To scan signatures, we will use `libhat`, a memory hacking library that includes a fast signature scanner.

For hooking, we will use `MinHook`.

## CPM
[CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) is a CMake library that makes it easier to add other libraries.

To use it, download `CPM.cmake` from the [latest release](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/releases) and save it at `cmake/CPM.cmake` in your project's directory.

Now, in your `CMakeLists.txt`, below the `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` line, add the following:

```cmake
include(cmake/CPM.cmake)
```

You now have CPM added to your project.

## Adding the Libraries

Below the CPM line, add the following:

```cmake
CPMAddPackage("gh:BasedInc/libhat@0.9.0")
CPMAddPackage("gh:TsudaKageyu/minhook@1.3.4")
```

This will make CPM automatically download the libraries. To use them in your mod, you must link against them. Add the following at the bottom of your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(<project_name_here> PRIVATE 
        libhat::libhat 
        minhook)
```

## Adding Your First Hook

Now, we will use `libhat` to scan for `Dimension::getTimeOfDay`. As of 1.21.120, the signature for `getTimeOfDay` is `44 8B C2 B8 F1 19 76 05 F7 EA`.

```cpp
#include <libhat/scanner.hpp>
#include <libhat/signature.hpp>

static DWORD WINAPI startup(LPVOID dll) {
    constexpr auto signature = hat::compile_signature<"44 8B C2 B8 F1 19 76 05 F7 EA">();

    hat::scan_result scanResult = hat::find_pattern(signature, ".text");
    std::byte* getTimeOfDay = scanResult.get();
}
```

Next, write the detour function which `MinHook` will redirect `getTimeOfDay` to.

```cpp
// MinHook will redirect Dimension::getTimeOfDay to this function, replacing its behavior with our own code.
static float hk_getTimeOfDay(void* _this, int32_t time, float alpha) {
    static float value = 0.f;
    value += 0.00001f;
    value = std::fmodf(value, 1.f);

    return value;
}
```

Finally, we'll initialize `MinHook` after scanning for `getTimeOfDay`, create a hook that redirects it to `hk_getTimeOfDay`, and enable that hook.
Then we will exit `startup`. Because of the way DLL injection works, this will cause our client to remain injected until the game is closed.

```cpp
#include <MinHook.h>

static DWORD WINAPI startup(LPVOID dll) {
    constexpr auto signature = hat::compile_signature<"44 8B C2 B8 F1 19 76 05 F7 EA">();

    hat::scan_result scanResult = hat::find_pattern(signature, ".text");
    std::byte* getTimeOfDay = scanResult.get();

    // Initialize MinHook.
    MH_Initialize();

    // Hook getTimeOfDay.
    LPVOID original;
    MH_CreateHook(getTimeOfDay, &hk_getTimeOfDay, &original);
    MH_EnableHook(getTimeOfDay);

    // Exiting this thread without calling FreeLibraryAndExitThread on `dll` will cause the DLL to remain injected forever.
    return 0;
}
```

Now build your mod again, and inject the DLL. If you see the sun and moon spinning around you, it worked!

You can try changing the constant in `hk_getTimeOfDay` to make the time go faster or slower.

::: tip
You can't build your mod while the DLL is injected. Close the game before building your mod again.
